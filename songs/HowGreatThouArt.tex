\begin{SBVerse}
O Lord my \Ch{G}{God}, when I in \Ch{C}{awesome} wonder

Consider \Ch{G}{all} the \Ch{D}{worlds} thy \Ch{C}{hands} have \Ch{G}{made},

I see the \Ch{G}{stars}, I hear the \Ch{C}{rolling} thunder,

Thy power through\Ch{G}{out} the \Ch{D}{uni}\Ch{C}{verse} \Ch{G}{displayed}:
\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBChorus}
Then sings my \Ch{G}{soul}, my \Ch{C}{Savior} God, to \Ch{G}{thee}:

How great thou \Ch{D-C}{art}! How great thou \Ch{G}{art}!

Then sings my \Ch{G}{soul}, my \Ch{C}{Savior} God, to \Ch{G-Em}{thee}:

How great thou \Ch{D-C}{art}! How great thou \Ch{G}{art}!
\end{SBChorus}

\begin{SBVerse}
When through the woods and forest glades I wander

And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees,

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur,

And hear the brook and feel the gentle breeze:
\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}
And when I think that God, his Son not sparing,

Sent him to die, I scarce can take it in,

That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing,

He bled and died to take away my sin:
\end{SBVerse}

\begin{SBVerse}
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation

And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart!

Then I shall bow in humble adoration,

And there proclaim, My God, how great thou art!
\end{SBVerse}
